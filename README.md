- 👋 Hi, I’m James! I am a Computer Science student at George Mason University about to start the second semester of my junior year. Aside from learning more about coding and prgramming, 
  I also enjoy cooking, camping & hiking, reading, and lifting weights. \
  
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about front end development, UI/UX design, cloud computing, and software design.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Node.js, AWS, and much more!

- 💞️ I’m looking for an Internship for the Summer of 2022 where I can learn more and enhance my skills!

- 📫 If you'd like to get in contact, send me an email at jamesryder42@gmail.com.
