-  Hi, I’m James! I am a recent Computer Science graduate from George Mason University currently seeking full time employment in the Washington DC or Richmond area. Aside from learning more about coding and prgramming, 
  I also enjoy cooking, camping & hiking, reading, and lifting weights. 
  
-  I’m interested in learning more about full stack development, UI/UX design, cloud computing, and software design. Additionally, I've been studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification, as well as AWS Certified Cloud       Practicioner.

-  I will be uploading more of my past projects here in the coming days, stay tuned!
